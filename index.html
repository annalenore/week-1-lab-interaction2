    <u>1. Describe your previous experience with coding</u>
    <h2> 1. What classes have you taken where you were exposed to HTML/CSS/JS?</h2> 
      <p>Just Core 1 - Interaction, and then the classes I have found online. </p>
    <h2> 2. What parts of the class resonated with you?</h2>
      <p> Really enjoyed building a collection and watching my progress over time by publishing week by week using GitHub. </p> 
    <h2> 3. Which parts were the most confusing?</h2>
      <p> My teacher never really explained CSS, just expected we would be able to use it, it felt like we went from simple HTML to JavaScript really fast. </p>  
    </h1>

    <h1> <u>2. How are you feeling about learning to code in this class? Nervous? Excited?</u></h1> 
      <p>I am really excited to learn more code, I do not want to rely on website templates or other people to do design work. </p>

    <h1> <u>3. How do you imagine coding fitting in with the rest of your design curriculum and career after college? </u></h1> 
      <p>I want to work for museums, specifically in their Graphic Design and branding departments, so designing and adapting online platforms is going to be super important. </p>

    <h1> <u>4. Describe the relationship between HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Which one(s) are required to create a webpage?</u> </h1> 
      <p>HTML is needed to create a website, CSS is for style and structure for the website, and javascript takes all of the information given and makes it function. </p>

    <h1> <u>5. Describe what GitHub does </u></h1> 
      <p>Github is a code hosting platform to collaborate and publish code for websites, as well as create a structured repository for projects of code. </p>

      Love the simplicity of this website and how all their branding matches. 
      Their products are meant to be soft on the skin and somewhat no coverage. 
      They have the values of creating products to enhance everyone's beauty, 
      rather than to cover up imperfections and make unrealistic beauty standards. 
      So it is understandable that they go for a super clean, and simple design,
      and use color as a means to enhance, and not a focal point. 
      Their grid style for their homepage too is very straightforward in terms of design,
      but in this case simple and easy is what they need. A user can use their website fast, 
      and get to their products fast without any obstacles.

      I love the evolution of Shepard Fairey's website, 
      I remember like 5 years ago it was super basic and 
      did not have a lot of his style in it. Now it matches 
      his work and his new brand super well. The way the 
      website flows from products to articles as you scroll 
      just how multi-faceted Fairey is, he has his hands in all 
      types of art and media, and needs his website to reflect that. 
      The color scheme of the dark grays and black mixed with the 
      bright red has always been the main colors in his work, and 
      I like how it compliments the webpage.

      Their website layout and aesthetic changes every album they release, which is super cool. 
      Like they do a complete overhaul of this site every year depending on the style of their album. 
      They just became independent too, so it's like one person doing their branding, and the lead singer 
      Mandy still does a lot of their social media. The bright colors and the electric nostalgia feel of 
      how it looks currently is an aesthetic I really enjoy, and want to incorporate more into my work.
